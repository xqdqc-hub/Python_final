    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Human expansion and landscape fragmentation have rapidly transformed elephant habitats across Southeast Asia. In Thailand’s Eastern Forest Complex (EFCOM), one of the last strongholds for Asian elephants, understanding how environmental and anthropogenic factors jointly shape habitat suitability is essential for conservation planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we develop two Random Forest models—one based solely on ecological variables, and another incorporating human-impact features such as roads and villages. Comparing the two suitability surfaces reveals the magnitude and spatial pattern of habitat loss. These results highlight potential corridor pathways, priority zones for restoration, and areas with elevated human–elephant conflict risks."
