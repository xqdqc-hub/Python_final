    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates how elephant habitat patterns in the Eastern Forest Complex are shaped not only by natural ecological conditions but also by the structure and intensity of human land use. While the natural-only model reveals large, cohesive forest interiors as core habitat, integrating human-impact variables exposes how roads, villages, and agricultural expansion fragment these landscapes. In some edge zones, suitability appears to increase due to crop attractiveness and the compression of elephant movement into narrower corridors—patterns that highlight where conflict risk is likely to rise as natural habitat is lost or subdivided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, the results underscore the dual role of conservation and land-use planning in shaping future human–elephant interactions. By revealing where habitat quality is suppressed, where suitability is artificially elevated, and where fragmentation most disrupts movement—particularly in the northern and southern forest belts—the models provide a practical framework for identifying priority areas for protection and conflict mitigation."

    "**Although our models were trained using real-world data from a human-modified landscape, they can still be used to explore more “natural” scenarios.** This works because the models capture what elephants prefer, not just where they happen to be found under current constraints. Even if human activities restrict elephants’ movement, their underlying habitat preferences remain the same. Using today’s data to imagine how elephants would use the landscape without human disturbance is therefore reasonable, and it helps illustrate how much the environment—and potential conflict zones—might change if human pressure were reduced."
