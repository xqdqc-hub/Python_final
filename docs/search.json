    "text": "Elephants & Study Area\n\nAsian Elephants: Why This Species Matters\nAsian elephants (Elephas maximus) are an Endangered species and one of the last remaining large herbivores in Southeast Asia. Over the past century, their populations have declined sharply due to habitat loss, poaching, agricultural expansion, and increasing human–elephant conflict. These conflicts often arise when elephants leave protected forests in search of food, entering plantations or villages. The result is a complex landscape where conservation goals intersect directly with agricultural livelihoods and community safety.\nUnderstanding where elephants prefer to live and how human activities reshape their available habitat is therefore essential for designing conservation strategies, anticipating risk, and reducing conflict.\n\n\nStudy Region\nThailand hosts roughly 4,000 wild elephants, and nearly half live in five major forest regions. Among them, the Eastern Forest Complex (EFCOM) is one of the largest and most ecologically significant. It also experiences some of the highest human–elephant conflict rates in the country, due to expanding plantations, road networks, and scattered settlements around its edges.\nThe elephants in EFCOM rely on a mosaic of evergreen forest, mixed forest, grassland, and water bodies within protected areas. However, the landscape around these forests is rapidly changing—rubber, palm, and fruit plantations form a patchwork around the protected core, creating narrow ecological corridors and limiting elephant movement.\nThe map below shows the geographic scope of this project—a section of the Eastern Forest Complex that includes protected forest, agricultural land, villages, water bodies, and transportation infrastructure. This spatial context is important for interpreting both elephant occurrence patterns and model results later in the analysis.\n\n\n\nImage Reference: Chaiyarat, R.; Wettasin, M.; Youngpoy, N.; Cheachean, N.

These covariates capture vegetation quality, land cover patterns, and the proximity of landscape elements that strongly shape elephant movement and space use.\nThe following subsections describe each covariate and present summary visualizations.\n\nLand Cover Composition\nThe land cover map below shows the spatial distribution of major habitat types within the Eastern Forest Complex (EFCOM). Evergreen forest (deep green) dominates the interior of the protected area, forming the core ecological zone where most elephant activity is expected to occur. Surrounding the protected forest, large patches of cropland and plantation (yellow and light green) create a fragmented transition zone between forest and human-modified landscapes.\nUrban and built-up areas (red) appear in scattered clusters, mostly along road networks and settlement centers, while water bodies (blue) are concentrated in the southern part of the region. This mosaic of forest, agriculture, villages, and infrastructure reflects the complex ecological and social environment in which elephants move.\n\n\nCode\nclass_colors = [\n    \"#ffffff\",  # 0  No data\n    \"#006400\",  # 10 Tree - dark green\n    \"#66a61e\",  # 20 Shrub - olive green\n    \"#b2df8a\",  # 30 Grass - light green\n    \"#ffd92f\",  # 40 Cropland - light yellow\n    \"#e41a1c\",  # 50 Built-up - red\n    \"#b3b3b3\",  # 60 Bare - grey\n    \"#f0f0f0\",  # 80 Snow/Ice - white\n    \"#1f78b4\",  # 90 Wetlands - teal blue\n    \"#0000ff\",  # 95 Water - blue\n]\n\n\ncmap = ListedColormap(class_colors)\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(7, 10))\nplt.imshow(lc_clip, cmap=cmap)\nplt.colorbar()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy Region: Landcover\n\n\n\n\nThe land cover distribution shows that tree cover dominates the study region, accounting for over half of all pixels and forming the ecological core of the Eastern Forest Complex. Cropland makes up about 22% of the area, creating a wide agricultural belt around the forest and representing the primary zone of human–elephant interaction and conflict.\nGrassland, built-up areas, and bare land occur in smaller patches but play an important role along forest edges and settlement clusters. Water bodies and wetlands represent less than 1% of the region but provide essential resources for elephant movement. Snow/Ice appears due to classification artifacts in the satellite imagery and does not represent actual environmental conditions in Thailand.\n\n\nCode\nclass_meaning = {\n    0:  \"No data\",\n    10: \"Tree cover\",\n    20: \"Shrubland\",\n    30: \"Grassland\",\n    40: \"Cropland\",\n    50: \"Built-up\",\n    60: \"Bare/Sparse vegetation\",\n    80: \"Snow/Ice\",\n    90: \"Wetlands\",\n    95: \"Water\"\n}\n\nunique, counts = np.unique(lc_clip, return_counts=True)\n\ndf_lc = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"ClassValue\": unique,\n    \"Meaning\": [class_meaning.get(v, \"Unknown\") for v in unique],\n    \"Count\": counts\n})\n\ndf_lc[\"Percentage\"] = (df_lc[\"Count\"] / df_lc[\"Count\"].sum() * 100).round(2)\n\ndf_lc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClassValue\nMeaning\nCount\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\nNo data\n292666\n0.55\n\n\n1\n10\nTree cover\n28505457\n53.90\n\n\n2\n20\nShrubland\n3019\n0.01\n\n\n3\n30\nGrassland\n4133549\n7.82\n\n\n4\n40\nCropland\n11810797\n22.33\n\n\n5\n50\nBuilt-up\n1499059\n2.83\n\n\n6\n60\nBare/Sparse vegetation\n292243\n0.55\n\n\n7\n80\nSnow/Ice\n5949448\n11.25\n\n\n8\n90\nWetlands\n91315\n0.17\n\n\n9\n95\nWater\n312213\n0.59\n\n\n\n\n\nLandcover types overview\n\n\nTo understand which environments elephants actually use within EFCOM, we extracted the land cover value at each occurrence point and calculated its percentage distribution.

To translate these features into variables the model could use, we calculated the shortest distance from each elephant occurrence point to each of these elements.

The strongest correlations appear among the human-related variables: distance to village and distance to water (0.89), and distance to road and distance to village (0.64), which is expected because settlements, roads, and water sources often cluster spatially. Despite these relationships, none of the correlations are high enough to cause concern for Random Forest, confirming that all variables can be meaningfully included without multicollinearity issues.\n\n\nCode\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(6,5))\nsns.heatmap(df[[\"NDVI\",\"dist_water\",\"dist_road\",\"dist_village\"]].corr(),\n            annot=True, cmap=\"YlGnBu\")\nplt.title(\"Correlation Between Features\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation Between Features"

    "text": "Model Building\nIn this section, we developed two sets of Random Forest classification models to understand how environmental and human-modified features influence elephant habitat use within the Eastern Forest Complex (EFCOM). We evaluated two conceptual frameworks:\n\nNatural Model – NDVI, land cover type, and distance to water\nHuman-Impact Model – adds distance to roads and villages\n\nThese two models allow us to directly compare how much additional explanatory power is introduced when incorporating anthropogenic disturbance variables.\n\nRandom Forest Method\nRandom Forest is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to produce a final, more stable output. Instead of relying on a single tree—which may overfit or be strongly influenced by noise—Random Forest averages across many trees, each trained on slightly different subsets of the data and features.\nStep1 Bootstrap Sampling: Each tree is trained on a randomly sampled subset of the training data (sampled with replacement).\nStep2 Random Feature Selection: At each split inside a tree, only a random subset of predictors is considered. This reduces correlation between trees and increases model robustness.\nStep3 Aggregation (Ensemble Prediction): For classification tasks (as in this project), each tree votes on the class.The majority vote becomes the final prediction.\n\n\n\nRandom Forest Diagram\n\n\n\n\nApproach\nTo model elephant habitat suitability, we trained a Random Forest classifier using presence–background data. The occurrence dataset with 260 points consisted of all available GPS elephant presence points within the study region. To represent the environmental space available to elephants, we generated 4,000 random background points across the landscape, ensuring full coverage of both forested and human-modified areas.\nEach point—presence or background—was annotated with key environmental variables (NDVI, land cover, distance to water) as well as human-impact variables (distance to roads and villages).\nWe then fit two Random Forest models, one using only natural predictors and another incorporating both natural and anthropogenic variables. All models were trained using a stratified 70/30 split to preserve the presence–background ratio, and hyperparameters followed standard defaults to ensure reproducibility. This workflow allowed us to compare how landscape features shape elephant habitat use and to evaluate the influence of human disturbance on predictive performance.\n\n\nWhy Random Forest Is Well-Suited for This Project?\nRandom Forest is particularly well-suited for this project because elephant habitat selection is driven by complex, nonlinear interactions between natural environmental features and human-modified landscapes. Variables such as NDVI, land cover, distance to water, roads, and villages do not influence elephants in simple linear ways; instead, their effects often depend on thresholds, combinations, and spatial context. Random Forest can naturally capture these nonlinear ecological responses without requiring explicit functional assumptions, making it ideal for modeling habitat suitability.\nThis combination of flexibility, interpretability, and predictive accuracy makes Random Forest one of the most widely used machine learning approaches in habitat suitability and conservation studies.\n\n\nCode\n# Natural model \nfeatures_natural = [\"NDVI\", \"LC\", \"dist_water\"]\n\n# Human-impact model \nfeatures_human = [\"NDVI\", \"LC\", \"dist_water\", \"dist_road\", \"dist_village\"]\n\nX_nat = df[features_natural]\nX_hum = df[features_human]\ny = df[\"presence\"]\n\n# Split train / test\nXnat_train, Xnat_test, ynat_train, ynat_test = train_test_split(\n    X_nat, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42, stratify=y\n)\n\nXhum_train, Xhum_test, yhum_train, yhum_test = train_test_split(\n    X_hum, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42, stratify=y\n)\n\n# Natural model\nrf_nat = RandomForestClassifier(\n    n_estimators=300,\n    max_depth=None,\n    random_state=42,\n    n_jobs=-1\n)\nrf_nat.fit(Xnat_train, ynat_train)\n\ny_nat_prob = rf_nat.predict_proba(Xnat_test)[:, 1]\nauc_nat = roc_auc_score(ynat_test, y_nat_prob)\nprint(\"Natural model AUC:\", round(auc_nat, 3))\n\n# Human-impact model\nrf_hum = RandomForestClassifier(\n    n_estimators=300,\n    max_depth=None,\n    random_state=42,\n    n_jobs=-1\n)\nrf_hum.fit(Xhum_train, yhum_train)\n\ny_hum_prob = rf_hum.predict_proba(Xhum_test)[:, 1]\nauc_hum = roc_auc_score(yhum_test, y_hum_prob)\nprint(\"Human-impact model AUC:\", round(auc_hum, 3))\n\n\nNatural model AUC: 0.714\nHuman-impact model AUC: 0.82"

This smooth pattern shows broad areas of intact forest functioning as cohesive habitat.\nWhen human-impact variables are added, the suitability surface becomes sharply fragmented. The prediction clearly shows how roads and settlements break up previously continuous habitat, leaving visible linear barriers across the landscape. At the same time, certain areas show increased suitability in the human-impact model. This occurs partly because cropland—especially cornfields—attracts elephants, and partly because human disturbance compresses elephants into narrower corridors. This compression elevates predicted occurrence probabilities and increases the contrast between high- and low-suitability zones.\nThe difference map reinforces this pattern. Human activity has the strongest negative impact in the northern and southern forest belts, where suitability drops substantially once roads, villages, and agricultural edges are accounted for. Most of these areas appear red, indicating habitat that would be highly suitable under natural conditions but is now degraded by fragmentation. Only limited blue patches remain, corresponding to agricultural edges where suitability rises due to food availability and forced movement. Overall, the maps illustrate how human land use simultaneously reduces the extent of natural habitat and intensifies elephant presence in a few high-risk interface zones.\n\n\nCode\nbase = r\"data/\"\n\nnat_path  = base + \"suitability_natural.tif\"\nhum_path  = base + \"suitability_human.tif\"\ndiff_path = base + \"difference_map.tif\"\n\nwith rasterio.open(nat_path) as src:\n    suit_nat = src.read(1)\n\nwith rasterio.open(hum_path) as src:\n    suit_hum = src.read(1)\n\nwith rasterio.open(diff_path) as src:\n    diff = src.read(1)\n\n# Suitability Maps of both models\nvmin_suit, vmax_suit = 0, 0.25\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(20, 7))\n\n# 1.

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis project demonstrates how elephant habitat patterns in the Eastern Forest Complex are shaped not only by natural ecological conditions but also by the structure and intensity of human land use. While the natural-only model reveals large, cohesive forest interiors as core habitat, integrating human-impact variables exposes how roads, villages, and agricultural expansion fragment these landscapes. In some edge zones, suitability appears to increase due to crop attractiveness and the compression of elephant movement into narrower corridors—patterns that highlight where conflict risk is likely to rise as natural habitat is lost or subdivided.\nTaken together, the results underscore the dual role of conservation and land-use planning in shaping future human–elephant interactions. By revealing where habitat quality is suppressed, where suitability is artificially elevated, and where fragmentation most disrupts movement—particularly in the northern and southern forest belts—the models provide a practical framework for identifying priority areas for protection and conflict mitigation.\nAlthough our models were trained using real-world data from a human-modified landscape, they can still be used to explore more “natural” scenarios. This works because the models capture what elephants prefer, not just where they happen to be found under current constraints. Even if human activities restrict elephants’ movement, their underlying habitat preferences remain the same. Using today’s data to imagine how elephants would use the landscape without human disturbance is therefore reasonable, and it helps illustrate how much the environment—and potential conflict zones—might change if human pressure were reduced."

These results highlight potential corridor pathways, priority zones for restoration, and areas with elevated human–elephant conflict risks.",

Over the past century, their populations have declined sharply due to habitat loss, poaching, agricultural expansion, and increasing human–elephant conflict. These conflicts often arise when elephants leave protected forests in search of food, entering plantations or villages. The result is a complex landscape where conservation goals intersect directly with agricultural livelihoods and community safety.\nUnderstanding where elephants prefer to live and how human activities reshape their available habitat is therefore essential for designing conservation strategies, anticipating risk, and reducing conflict.\n\n\nStudy Region\nThailand hosts roughly 4,000 wild elephants, and nearly half live in five major forest regions. Among them, the Eastern Forest Complex (EFCOM) is one of the largest and most ecologically significant. It also experiences some of the highest human–elephant conflict rates in the country, due to expanding plantations, road networks, and scattered settlements around its edges.\nThe elephants in EFCOM rely on a mosaic of evergreen forest, mixed forest, grassland, and water bodies within protected areas. However, the landscape around these forests is rapidly changing—rubber, palm, and fruit plantations form a patchwork around the protected core, creating narrow ecological corridors and limiting elephant movement.\nThe map below shows the geographic scope of this project—a section of the Eastern Forest Complex that includes protected forest, agricultural land, villages, water bodies, and transportation infrastructure. This spatial context is important for interpreting both elephant occurrence patterns and model results later in the analysis.\n\n\n\nImage Reference: Chaiyarat, R.; Wettasin, M.; Youngpoy, N.; Cheachean, N.

    "text": "In this section, we developed two sets of Random Forest classification models to understand how environmental and human-modified features influence elephant habitat use within the Eastern Forest Complex (EFCOM). We evaluated two conceptual frameworks:\n\nNatural Model – NDVI, land cover type, and distance to water\nHuman-Impact Model – adds distance to roads and villages\n\nThese two models allow us to directly compare how much additional explanatory power is introduced when incorporating anthropogenic disturbance variables.\n\nRandom Forest Method\nRandom Forest is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to produce a final, more stable output. Instead of relying on a single tree—which may overfit or be strongly influenced by noise—Random Forest averages across many trees, each trained on slightly different subsets of the data and features.\nStep1 Bootstrap Sampling: Each tree is trained on a randomly sampled subset of the training data (sampled with replacement).\nStep2 Random Feature Selection: At each split inside a tree, only a random subset of predictors is considered. This reduces correlation between trees and increases model robustness.\nStep3 Aggregation (Ensemble Prediction): For classification tasks (as in this project), each tree votes on the class.The majority vote becomes the final prediction.\n\n\n\nRandom Forest Diagram\n\n\n\n\nApproach\nTo model elephant habitat suitability, we trained a Random Forest classifier using presence–background data. The occurrence dataset with 260 points consisted of all available GPS elephant presence points within the study region. To represent the environmental space available to elephants, we generated 4,000 random background points across the landscape, ensuring full coverage of both forested and human-modified areas.\nEach point—presence or background—was annotated with key environmental variables (NDVI, land cover, distance to water) as well as human-impact variables (distance to roads and villages).\nWe then fit two Random Forest models, one using only natural predictors and another incorporating both natural and anthropogenic variables. All models were trained using a stratified 70/30 split to preserve the presence–background ratio, and hyperparameters followed standard defaults to ensure reproducibility. This workflow allowed us to compare how landscape features shape elephant habitat use and to evaluate the influence of human disturbance on predictive performance.\n\n\nWhy Random Forest Is Well-Suited for This Project?\nRandom Forest is particularly well-suited for this project because elephant habitat selection is driven by complex, nonlinear interactions between natural environmental features and human-modified landscapes. Variables such as NDVI, land cover, distance to water, roads, and villages do not influence elephants in simple linear ways; instead, their effects often depend on thresholds, combinations, and spatial context. Random Forest can naturally capture these nonlinear ecological responses without requiring explicit functional assumptions, making it ideal for modeling habitat suitability.\nThis combination of flexibility, interpretability, and predictive accuracy makes Random Forest one of the most widely used machine learning approaches in habitat suitability and conservation studies.\n\n\nCode\n# Natural model \nfeatures_natural = [\"NDVI\", \"LC\", \"dist_water\"]\n\n# Human-impact model \nfeatures_human = [\"NDVI\", \"LC\", \"dist_water\", \"dist_road\", \"dist_village\"]\n\nX_nat = df[features_natural]\nX_hum = df[features_human]\ny = df[\"presence\"]\n\n# Split train / test\nXnat_train, Xnat_test, ynat_train, ynat_test = train_test_split(\n    X_nat, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42, stratify=y\n)\n\nXhum_train, Xhum_test, yhum_train, yhum_test = train_test_split(\n    X_hum, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42, stratify=y\n)\n\n# Natural model\nrf_nat = RandomForestClassifier(\n    n_estimators=300,\n    max_depth=None,\n    random_state=42,\n    n_jobs=-1\n)\nrf_nat.fit(Xnat_train, ynat_train)\n\ny_nat_prob = rf_nat.predict_proba(Xnat_test)[:, 1]\nauc_nat = roc_auc_score(ynat_test, y_nat_prob)\nprint(\"Natural model AUC:\", round(auc_nat, 3))\n\n# Human-impact model\nrf_hum = RandomForestClassifier(\n    n_estimators=300,\n    max_depth=None,\n    random_state=42,\n    n_jobs=-1\n)\nrf_hum.fit(Xhum_train, yhum_train)\n\ny_hum_prob = rf_hum.predict_proba(Xhum_test)[:, 1]\nauc_hum = roc_auc_score(yhum_test, y_hum_prob)\nprint(\"Human-impact model AUC:\", round(auc_hum, 3))\n\n\nNatural model AUC: 0.756\nHuman-impact model AUC: 0.836",

    "section": "",
    "text": "This project demonstrates how elephant habitat patterns in the Eastern Forest Complex are shaped not only by natural ecological conditions but also by the structure and intensity of human land use. While the natural-only model reveals large, cohesive forest interiors as core habitat, integrating human-impact variables exposes how roads, villages, and agricultural expansion fragment these landscapes. In some edge zones, suitability appears to increase due to crop attractiveness and the compression of elephant movement into narrower corridors—patterns that highlight where conflict risk is likely to rise as natural habitat is lost or subdivided.\nTaken together, the results underscore the dual role of conservation and land-use planning in shaping future human–elephant interactions. By revealing where habitat quality is suppressed, where suitability is artificially elevated, and where fragmentation most disrupts movement—particularly in the northern and southern forest belts—the models provide a practical framework for identifying priority areas for protection and conflict mitigation.\nAlthough our models were trained using real-world data from a human-modified landscape, they can still be used to explore more “natural” scenarios. This works because the models capture what elephants prefer, not just where they happen to be found under current constraints. Even if human activities restrict elephants’ movement, their underlying habitat preferences remain the same. Using today’s data to imagine how elephants would use the landscape without human disturbance is therefore reasonable, and it helps illustrate how much the environment—and potential conflict zones—might change if human pressure were reduced.",

This smooth pattern shows broad areas of intact forest functioning as cohesive habitat.\nWhen human-impact variables are added, the suitability surface becomes sharply fragmented. The prediction clearly shows how roads and settlements break up previously continuous habitat, leaving visible linear barriers across the landscape. At the same time, certain areas show increased suitability in the human-impact model. This occurs partly because cropland—especially cornfields—attracts elephants, and partly because human disturbance compresses elephants into narrower corridors. This compression elevates predicted occurrence probabilities and increases the contrast between high- and low-suitability zones.\nThe difference map reinforces this pattern. Human activity has the strongest negative impact in the northern and southern forest belts, where suitability drops substantially once roads, villages, and agricultural edges are accounted for. Most of these areas appear red, indicating habitat that would be highly suitable under natural conditions but is now degraded by fragmentation. Only limited blue patches remain, corresponding to agricultural edges where suitability rises due to food availability and forced movement. Overall, the maps illustrate how human land use simultaneously reduces the extent of natural habitat and intensifies elephant presence in a few high-risk interface zones.\n\n\nCode\nbase = r\"data/\"\n\nnat_path  = base + \"suitability_natural.tif\"\nhum_path  = base + \"suitability_human.tif\"\ndiff_path = base + \"difference_map.tif\"\n\nwith rasterio.open(nat_path) as src:\n    suit_nat = src.read(1)\n\nwith rasterio.open(hum_path) as src:\n    suit_hum = src.read(1)\n\nwith rasterio.open(diff_path) as src:\n    diff = src.read(1)\n\n# Suitability Maps of both models\nvmin_suit, vmax_suit = 0, 0.25\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(20, 7))\n\n# 1.

Evergreen forest (deep green) dominates the interior of the protected area, forming the core ecological zone where most elephant activity is expected to occur. Surrounding the protected forest, large patches of cropland and plantation (yellow and light green) create a fragmented transition zone between forest and human-modified landscapes.\nUrban and built-up areas (red) appear in scattered clusters, mostly along road networks and settlement centers, while water bodies (blue) are concentrated in the southern part of the region.

The strongest correlations appear among the human-related variables: distance to village and distance to water (0.89), and distance to road and distance to village (0.64), which is expected because settlements, roads, and water sources often cluster spatially.
